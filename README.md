This repository contains code and data for quantifying seasonal subsurface supply of dissolved iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) to the Southern Ocean surface via winter entrainment, diapycnal diffusion, and Ekman upwelling. These sub-nanomolar trace metals are essential for phytoplankton growth and act as cofactors in key metabolic processes.
